# AutoDamageNet ‚Äì Vehicle Damage Detection  

## üöó Overview  
AutoDamageNet is a deep learning project designed to automatically detect **vehicle damage**. The model classifies images of vehicles into **6 categories**:  

- Front Breakage  
- Front Crush  
- Front Normal  
- Rear Breakage  
- Rear Crush  
- Rear Normal  

This system can help in **insurance claims, accident assessment, and vehicle inspection automation**.
